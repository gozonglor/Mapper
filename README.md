# Action Item: Build VISUAL/UI (Hmong, Cody, Nelson)
- Non functioning map
- includes being able to drag and drop pallets onto the map
- (this is important to consider if you are building a save and load map function to ui) data structure (for the time being): pallets have x and y aspect/property
[ 0 0 0 1 5 6 ] = represents a map
and references the pallet identified by number/or/name (i.e. pallet 5 is drawn on the map at (3,0))

Cody was here (on eclipse!)
